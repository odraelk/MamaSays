# MamaSays
Fragmento de la cancion mama says - lukas graham

When mama said that is was okay
Mama said that is was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us that we were good kids
And daddy told us never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun
'Cause we were good kids
